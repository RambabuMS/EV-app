    power: "129 HP max-power and 245Nm max-torque",
    range: "312 km ARAI claimed",
    info: "All versions of the Tata Nexon EV get dual airbags, ABS, reverse parking sensors and ISOFIX child seat mounts. The base XM trim version gets LED DRLs, part-digital dials, drive modes, power windows, keyless entry and go and an audio system with bluetooth connectivity. Mid-spec XZ+ versions make the most sense adding in alloy wheels, rear wash/wipe, rear parking camera, rear air-con vents, a driver’s seat height adjust, a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay among other features. The top-spec Nexon EV XZ+ Lux gets the most goodies including a sunroof, leatherette upholstery and auto headlights and wipers. However, it is quite pricey for what is a compact SUV. ",

The only physical buttons are positioned on the centre console and they control the drive modes (more on this later), regenerative braking and hazard lights.",
